# MinesweeperX

This project is my first attempt of exploring the [HTMX library](https://htmx.org/).
I decided to give it a shot implementing a Minesweeper clone and, honestly, I had a ton of fun!

## Requirements

- Go 1.22
- An internet connection (at this very moment third-party libraries are accessed via CDN)

## Build

Clone the repository in your machine and then run the following command in the project folder:

```
go build .
```

This will create a _Minesweeperx_ executable file

## Run

Just run the _Minesweeperx_ executable file or, in case you didn't build it,
run the following in the project folder:

```
go run .
```

## Tech Stack

- **Go** for back-end
- **HTMX** for front-end
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **FontAwesome** for, well, icons
